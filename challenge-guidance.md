# Modern Challenge Lab authoring

We have recently updated the look and feel of challenge labs. In the process, the way we implement some instruction elements has changed. The following examples can be used in your instructions:

**Hint**


```
><details class="hint-icon">
><summary title="Select to Expand">Expand this hint for guidance on creating hints</summary>
>    - Give the learner guidance on the next task.
>    - Each hint should describe one instructional step. 
>    - Learners should be able to expand a hint for one step without seeing any other hints for the task.
>    - The hint tells the "how" of the task.
>    - Use an expandable hint to provide learners with the details of how to perform the action in >the step. 
>   
></details>

```
